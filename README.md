ARGG is used by Half-Life 2: Sandbox to implement rotational functionality for the physics manipulator.

**Open Steamworks**  
Open Steamworks is used in Half-Life 2: Sandbox for mounting additional game content through Steam's abstraction layer rather than the game engine's filesystem class, which prevents non-fatal engine errors.
